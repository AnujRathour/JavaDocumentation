            Java is a popular, platform-independent programming language developed
            by Sun Microsystems. It follows an object-oriented approach and emphasizes
            simplicity and readability. With its "write once, run anywhere" principle,
            Java programs can be executed on different platforms using the Java Virtual
            Machine (JVM). It has a vast ecosystem and is widely used for developing
            a wide range of applications, including desktop, web, and mobile applications.
            </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                client-side Java is commonly used for building desktop applications, 
                mobile apps (specifically for Android), and web applets (although applets
                have become less common in recent years).For desktop applications, Java provides
                 a framework called Swing that allows developers to create graphical user 
                 interfaces (GUIs). Swing provides a set of components, such as buttons,
                text fields, and menus, which can be used to build interactive desktop applications.
            </li>
            <li> server side, Java is widely used for developing web applications and backend systems.
                 It offers various frameworks and libraries like Spring and Java EE for building scalable
                and secure server-side applications. Java's strong support for multithreading and robust
                exception handling makes it suitable for handling concurrent requests and managing 
                complex server-side logic. Its platform independence and extensive ecosystem contribute
                 to its popularity in server-side development.</li>

            <article>
            <p>If I had to narrow it down to the three main things a student needs to know to learn Java, they would be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Java is an object-oriented language,
                     so having a good understanding of OOP concepts like classes, objects, 
                     inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation is essential. It is recommended
                      to learn OOP before diving into Java programming.</li>
                <li>Java Syntax and Language Features: Java has its own syntax, and a beginner
                     needs to be familiar with the basic syntax rules, including declaring variables,
                      writing functions, using conditionals and loops, handling exceptions, and memory
                       management through garbage collection.</li>
                <li>
                    Java Development Environment: A student must have a Java development environment
                     installed on their computer, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.
                      Understanding how to create a new project, write code, compile, and run 
                      Java programs using an IDE is essential for learning Java.
                </li>

                    static void greetme(){
                        System.out.println("Hello World");
                    }
                    greetme();

            <header>Declaring variables</header>  
            <article><p>
                In Java, variables are declared by specifying the
                 data type followed by the variable name. Here's the
                  syntax for variable declaration in Java:
            </p>
        <code>int count = 10;
            double temperature = 25.5;
            boolean isActive = true;
            String message = "Hello, world!";
            </code>
    </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
           <header>Variable scope</header>
           <article>
           <p>In Java, the scope of a variable determines its visibility and accessibility
             within a program. The scope determines where the variable can be accessed and 
             used. Java supports several types of variable scopes, including:</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Local Scope: Variables declared within a method, constructor, or a block 
                    of code have local scope. They are only accessible within that specific 
                    code block and are not visible outside of it. Once the block of code is exited,
                    the variable goes out of scope and cannot be accessed anymore.</li>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <code>public void someMethod() {
                        int x = 10; // local variable
                        System.out.println(x); // x is accessible within this method
                    }
                    </code>
                <li>Instance Scope: Variables declared at the class level but not within any method
                     are instance variables. They have instance scope and are accessible to all methods
                      and blocks within the class. Each instance of the class (object) has its own copy 
                      of the instance variables.</li>
                      <p>Example:</p>
                      <code>public class MyClass {
                        private int x; // instance variable
                        
                        public void setX(int value) {
                            x = value; // assigning a value to the instance variable
                        }
                        
                        public void printX() {
                            System.out.println(x); // accessing the instance variable
                        }
                    }
                    </code>
                <li>Class Scope (Static Scope): Variables declared with the static keyword at the class level 
                    are called class variables or static variables. They have class scope and are shared 
                    among all instances of the class. They can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.
                </li>
               
             </ul>
              <p>Example:</p>
                <code>public class MyClass {
                    private static int count; // class variable
                    
                    public MyClass() {
                        count++; // accessing the class variable
                    }
                    
                    public static void printCount() {
                        System.out.println(count); // accessing the class variable
                    }
                }
                </code>

            <header>Global variables</header>
            <article>
            <p>In Java, global variables, also known as class-level variables,
                 are declared at the class level but outside of any method, constructor,
                  or block. They have a broader scope compared to local variables and can 
                  be accessed from any part of the class, including methods, constructors, and blocks.</p>
                <p>To declare a global variable in Java, you need to declare it as an instance variable by
                     placing it within the class but outside of any method or block. Here's an example:</p>
                     <code>public class MyClass {
                        // Global variable or instance variable
                        private int globalVar;
                    
                        public void setGlobalVar(int value) {
                            globalVar = value; // Assigning a value to the global variable
                        }
                    
                        public void printGlobalVar() {
                            System.out.println(globalVar); // Accessing the global variable
                        }
                    
                        // Other methods and code blocks can also access the global variable
                    }
                    </code>
                    <p>In the above example, the variable globalVar is declared as an instance variable
                         within the class MyClass. It can be accessed and modified by any method within the class.
                          Each instance of the class (object) will have its own copy of the global variable.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
            <article>
            <p>In Java, constants are variables whose values cannot be changed once they are assigned. 
                They are typically used to store values that are fixed and do not need to be modified 
                during the execution of a program. Java provides a way to define constants using the final keyword.</p>
                <p>To declare a constant in Java, follow these steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li type="number">Declare the constant variable and assign it a value.</li>
                    <li type="number">Use the final keyword to indicate that the variable is a constant and cannot be reassigned.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here's an example:</p>
                <code>public class MyClass {
                    public static final int MAX_VALUE = 100; // Constant variable
                
                    public static void main(String[] args) {
                        System.out.println(MAX_VALUE); // Accessing the constant variable
                        // MAX_VALUE = 200; // Error: Cannot assign a new value to a constant variable
                    }
                }
                </code>
                <p>In the example above, the constant MAX_VALUE is declared as a 
                    static final variable within the class MyClass. It is assigned a value of 100 
                    and cannot be changed afterward. The final keyword ensures that the variable is a constant.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
        <header>Data types</header>
        <article>
        <p>In Java, data types define the types of values that can be stored and manipulated by variables. 
            Java provides a set of built-in primitive data types and also allows for the creation of user-defined 
            custom data types using classes and interfaces. Here are the commonly used data types in Java:</p>
            <ul>Primitive Data Types:
                <li>byte: Represents a 1-byte integer value ranging from -128 to 127.</li>
                <li>short: Represents a 2-byte integer value ranging from -32,768 to 32,767.</li>
                <li>int: Represents a 4-byte integer value ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.</li>
                <li>long: Represents an 8-byte integer value ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.</li>
                <li>float: Represents a 4-byte floating-point value with decimal precision.</li>
                <li>double: Represents an 8-byte floating-point value with higher decimal precision.</li>
                <li>boolean: Represents a boolean value (true or false).</li>
                <li>char: Represents a single character value, such as 'A' or '5'</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Reference/Object Data Types:
               <li>String: Represents a sequence of characters.</li>
               <li>Array: Represents a collection of elements of the same type.</li>
               <li>Class: Represents a class type.</li>
               <li>Interface: Represents an interface type.</li>
               <li>Enum: Represents a predefined set of constants.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to the built-in data types, Java supports the creation of custom data types through classes and interfaces.
                 These custom data types can have their own properties (variables) and behaviors (methods).
                  By creating classes and defining their fields and methods, you can create objects and work
                   with more complex data structures.</p>

            <p>  Here's an example of using a custom class to define a custom data type:</p>
                <code>public class Person {
                    private String name;
                    private int age;
                
                    public Person(String name, int age) {
                        this.name = name;
                        this.age = age;
                    }
                
                    public void greet() {
                        System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + name + " and I'm " + age + " years old.");
                    }
                
                    // Getters and setters for name and age
                    // ...
                }
                </code>
                <p>In this example, the Person class represents a custom data type that has two fields (name and age)
                     and a method (greet()) to greet the person. You can create instances of this class and access its
                      fields and methods.</p>
                      <code>public class Main {
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                            Person person1 = new Person("John", 25);
                            Person person2 = new Person("Alice", 30);
                    
                            person1.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I'm 25 years old.
                            person2.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice and I'm 30 years old.
                        }
                    }

            <header>if...else statement</header>
            <p>In Java, the if-else statement allows you to control the flow of your program based on a certain condition
                . It provides a way to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.
                 The general syntax of the if-else statement is as follows:</p>
                 <code>if (condition) {
                    // Code to execute if the condition is true
                } else {

        <p>In Java, functions are declared as methods within a class. A method is a block
             of code that performs a specific task and can be called and executed when needed.
              Method declarations specify the access modifier, return type, method name,
               parameters, and the body of the method. Here's the general syntax for declaring 
               a method in Java:</p>
            <code><access modifier> <return type> <method name>(<parameters>) {
                // Method body
                // Code to be executed
                // Optional return statement
            }
            </code>
            <ul>Let's break down each component of the method declaration:
                <li><access modifier>: Specifies the visibility of the method, such as public,
                     private, or protected. If no access modifier is specified, it defaults to
                      package-private.</li>
                <li><return type>: Specifies the type of value that the method returns after execution. 
                    Use void if the method does not return any value.</li>
                <li><method name>: Specifies the name of the method, following Java naming conventions.
                     It should be descriptive and indicate the purpose of the method.</li>
                <li><parameters>: Specifies the input parameters (if any) that the method accepts. 
                    Parameters are optional and can have a type and a name.</li>
                <li>Method body: The block of code that contains the instructions to be executed when the method is called.
                     It is enclosed within curly braces {}.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here's an example of a method declaration in Java:</p>
            <code>public class MyClass {
                public void greet(String name) {
                    System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
                }
            
                public int sum(int a, int b) {
                    int result = a + b;
                    return result;
                }
            
                private void doSomething() {
                    // Method body with no parameters and no return type
                    // ...
                }
            }
